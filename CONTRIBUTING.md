How to Contribute
-----------------

We're excited to have you contribute to our MCP event to hist software (`sophiread`)!

If you are not comfortable with coding, please submit your feature request and bug report via Github issues and ping one of the maintainers (@KedoKudo, @suannchong).
If you would like to contribute to the source code, here's how to get started:

- Fork the repository on GitHub if you are not part of team `ornlneutronimaging`.
- Create a new branch for your contribution.
- Make your changes to the code.
- Write unit tests for your changes.
- Format your code using clang-format.
- Submit a pull request.

Also, we would really appreciate if you could consider the following guidelines before submitting your pull request:

- Please consider adding unit test for any new features. This helps us to ensure that your changes work as expected and that they don't break existing functionality.

- Please consider using clang-format to format your code. This helps us to ensure that the code is consistent and easy to read.

- We prefer native implementations over adding additional external dependencies. This helps us to keep the code base small and easy to maintain.


If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue or contact us directly or via the discussion forum.

We can't wait to see what you build! ðŸ˜¸
